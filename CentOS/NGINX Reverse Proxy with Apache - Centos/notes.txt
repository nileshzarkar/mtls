What is a proxy server?
In computer networking, a proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting 
a resource and the server providing that resource.

What is a reverse proxy server?
A proxy service which takes a client request, passes it on to one or more servers.
Proxying is typically used to distribute the load among several servers, 
seamlessly show content from different websites, 
or pass requests for processing to application servers over protocols other than HTTP.

Firewall should be disabled on this server
systemctl status firewalld ==> systemctl stop firewalld 
You should have APACHE (httpd) running on port 8080
nano /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  ==> Listen 8080
You should have the nginx running on port 80

Changes in the conf for reverse proxy
Config Location : /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
or 
Config Location : /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
location / {
        # root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        # index  index.html index.htm;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
        # the value of proxy_pass is the value of the apache (httpd) server 
    }

 Access NGINX url and you should see Apache page    
Hit http://192.168.101.12/  ==> You may hit the error page

Check logs 
/var/log/nginx

cat /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep nginx | grep denied

How to solve access denied issue in NGINX reverse proxy?
type=AVC msg=audit(1693102310.296:333): avc:  denied  { name_connect } for  pid=27946 comm="nginx" 
dest=8080 scontext=system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 
tcontext=system_u:object_r:http_cache_port_t:s0 tclass=tcp_socket permissive=0

OR 

[crit] 59982#0: *2 connect() to 127.0.0.1:8080 failed (13: Permission denied) 
while connecting to upstream, 
client: 192.168.29.179, server: _, request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", upstream: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/", host: "192.168.29.41"

Solution: 
List of all the httpd SELInux boolean
#getsebool -a | grep httpd

Enable network connect boolean 
#setsebool httpd_can_network_connect on -P

Hit http://192.168.101.12/  ==> You will see the apache page

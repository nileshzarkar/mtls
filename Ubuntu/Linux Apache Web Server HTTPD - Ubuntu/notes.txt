apt update
apt install apache2
apache2 -version

Firewall configuration
We will now need to open some ports on our system to access Apache externally. First, let's mention the application profiles that we will provide Apache access to. Execute the below command to do it:

ufw app list  
We can see distinct Apache profiles in the following screenshot:

We will apply the highly restrictive 'Apache' profile to activate network connectivity on 80 port.
ufw allow 'Apache'  
ufw status

Setting up Apache Web Server; Verify Apache Service

First, we will verify the Apache service is running before moving to the configuration process. We will run the following command in the terminal window to do so:

systemctl status apache2
We can find the Apache service is running and active from the above result. Another method to verify the Apache service is activated is by claiming a web page through the Apache web server. We need to find our IP address with the below command to do so:

hostname -I  

How to Manage the Apache Server?

Here are a few of the helpful commands that we can execute in the terminal window for managing the Apache server.

For starting the Apache server:
systemctl start apache2e  
For stopping the Apache server:
systemctl stop apache2  
For stopping and starting the Apache server:
systemctl stop apache2  
For reloading the Apache server for updating the fresh configurations:
systemctl reload apache2  
For starting the Apache server at the boot time:
systemctl enable apache2  
For disabling the Apache server at the boot time:
systemctl disable apache2  

Config Location:
/etc/apache2/apache2.conf
/var/www/html/index.html

Logs:
/var/log/apache2/

From laptop to vm ip : http://192.168.101.5/

To check firewall status use the ufw status command in the terminal.
sudo ufw status
For more detailed status use verbose option with ufw status command.
sudo ufw status verbose
